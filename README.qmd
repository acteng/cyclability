This repo contains ideas, code, and example data to estimate 'cyclability' on transport networks.

## What is cyclability?

There are at least three definitions of how conducive to
cycling different places, routes and segments of travel networks are:

- [Level of Traffic
  Stress](https://docs.conveyal.com/learn-more/traffic-stress) (LTS)
- [Bikeability](https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/cycletraining/article/ct20110111-cycletraining-What-is-Bikeability-0)
  levels, which rates infrastructure based on the level of training
  needed to feel comfortable:
  - Level 1 teaches basic bike-handling skills in a controlled
    traffic-free environment.
  - Level 2 teaches trainees to cycle planned routes on minor roads,
    offering a real cycling experience.
  - Level 3 ensures trainees are able to manage a variety of traffic
    conditions and is delivered on busier roads with advanced features
    and layouts
- CycleStreetsâ€™s [Quietness
  rating](https://www.cyclestreets.net/help/journey/howitworks/#quietness)
  from 1 (very unpleasant for cycling) to 100 (the quietest)
  - The [BNA tool](https://bna.peopleforbikes.org/#/) which builds on the concept of traffic stress to classify segments as Low Stress or High Stress.

## Example data

### Data from Leeds, UK

Datasets containing estimates of 'quietness' and 'cyclability' for Leeds, UK, are available from the a separate [repo](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/cyclability/).
These datasets were taken from an area with the following bounding box:

```
     xmin      ymin      xmax      ymax 
-1.571467 53.797790 -1.541108 53.815759 
```

This area, representing a 1 km boundary around the University of Leeds (-1.556288, 53.80677) can be seen in OSM at the following URL: https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/53.8068/-1.5563

<!-- To prepare the input data we used the `osmium-tool` command line utility which can be installed on Ubuntu with the following command: -->

```bash
sudo npm install -g osmtogeojson
```

#### OSM data

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
leeds_university = tmaptools::geocode_OSM("university of leeds", as.sf = TRUE)
leeds_smallarea = stplanr::geo_buffer(shp = leeds_university, dist = 1000)
dir.create("example-data")
leeds_bounding_polygon = stplanr::bb2poly(sf::st_bbox(leeds_smallarea))
sf::write_sf(leeds_bounding_polygon, "example-data/leeds_bounding_polygon.geojson")
sf::st_bbox(leeds_smallarea)
```

OSM data was downloaded from overpass with the following command which uses `wget` to query the API for the bounding box:
  
```bash
 #| eval: false
wget -O example-data/leeds.osm "https://overpass-api.de/api/interpreter?data=[out:xml][timeout:25];(way[highway](53.797790,-1.571467,53.815759,-1.541108);node(w););out body;>;out skel qt;"
```

The output of the command above can be found in the `example-data` folder of this repo.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
osmtogeojson example-data/leeds.osm > example-data/leeds.geojson
```

<!-- Convert this to GeoJSON with the following command (requires `osmium-tool`): -->

```{bash}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
osmium cat -o example-data/leeds.geojson example-data/leeds.osm
```

```{r}
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
leeds_osm_osm = sf::read_sf("example-data/leeds.osm", layer = "lines")
leeds_osm_geojson = sf::read_sf("example-data/leeds.geojson")
names(leeds_osm_geojson)
nrow(leeds_osm_geojson)
nrow(leeds_osm_osm)
```

The OSM data can be seen in the map below:

```{r}
#| echo: false
plot(sf::st_geometry(leeds_osm_osm))
```

The example dataset contains around 3k line segments and 200 keys with at least one value.

#### Quietness

A GeoJSON file with quietness estimates for each road segment in Leeds is available at https://github.com/ITSLeeds/cyclability/raw/main/cyclestreets/leeds_quietness.geojson and is illustrated below:

```{r}
leeds_quietness = sf::read_sf("https://github.com/ITSLeeds/cyclability/raw/main/cyclestreets/leeds_quietness.geojson")
plot(leeds_quietness["quietness"])
leeds_quietness |>
  sf::st_drop_geometry() |>
  dplyr::slice(1:3) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

A simple model was used to find out the relationship between the quietness rating and riding surface:

```{r}
#| echo: false
model_lm = lm(quietness ~ ridingSurface, data = leeds_quietness)
model_tidy = broom::tidy(model_lm)
intercept = model_tidy |>
  dplyr::filter(term == "(Intercept)") |>
  dplyr::pull(estimate)
# Visualise the resulting model with ggplot2:
# model_tidy$term = as.factor(model_tidy$term)
# levels(model_tidy$term) = model_tidy$term[order(model_tidy$estimate)]
# model_tidy$term = ordered(model_tidy$term)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
model_tidy |>
  dplyr::filter(term != "(Intercept)") |>
  mutate(estimate = estimate + intercept) |>
  # mutate(term = gsub("ridingSurface", "", term)) |>
  ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(x = estimate, y = term)) +
  ggplot2::geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  ggplot2::labs(x = "Quietness estimate", y = "ridingSurface (CycleStreets)")
```

From this we can see that, as would be expected, living streets and pedestrianised areas are associated with the highest quietness ratings.

```{r}

```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
# Predict quietness as a function of ridingSurface with lightGBM
remotes::install_cran("lightgbm")
remotes::install_cran("bonsai")
library(bonsai)
set.seed(2023)
leeds_quietness_df = leeds_quietness |>
  sf::st_drop_geometry() |>
  dplyr::select(quietness, ridingSurface)
dt_mod = boost_tree() |>
  set_engine(engine = "lightgbm") %>%
  set_mode(mode = "regression") %>%
  fit(
    formula = quietness ~ ridingSurface, 
    data = leeds_quietness_df
  )
dt_mod
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
# Failed lightgbm example:
quietness_model = lightgbm::lightgbm(
  quietness ~ ridingSurface,
  data = leeds_quietness |> sf::st_drop_geometry(),
  objective = "regression",
  metric = "rmse",
  num_iterations = 1000,
  learning_rate = 0.1,
  num_leaves = 31,
  min_data_in_leaf = 20,
  bagging_fraction = 0.8,
  bagging_freq = 5,
  feature_fraction = 0.8,
  early_stopping_round = 10
)
```

## Thoughts on next steps (draft)

- [ ] Prototype code to generate plausible quietness ratings from OpenStreetMap data
- [ ] Wire up to a web interface
- [ ] Create a frontent to allow people to tweak the parameters affecting cyclability
- [ ] Develop default settings e.g. for different types of users (e.g. novice, experienced, confident) and implementations of different metrics (e.g. Bikeability 1 to 3 or LTS 1 to 4)
- [ ] Encode the settings that lead to these implementations in a human readable and easy-to-edit format, e.g. JSON
