This repo contains ideas, code, and example data to estimate 'cyclability' on transport networks.

## What is cyclability?

There are at least three definitions of how conducive to
cycling different places, routes and segments of travel networks are:

- [Level of Traffic
  Stress](https://docs.conveyal.com/learn-more/traffic-stress) (LTS)
- [Bikeability](https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/cycletraining/article/ct20110111-cycletraining-What-is-Bikeability-0)
  levels, which rates infrastructure based on the level of training
  needed to feel comfortable:
  - Level 1 teaches basic bike-handling skills in a controlled
    traffic-free environment.
  - Level 2 teaches trainees to cycle planned routes on minor roads,
    offering a real cycling experience.
  - Level 3 ensures trainees are able to manage a variety of traffic
    conditions and is delivered on busier roads with advanced features
    and layouts
- CycleStreetsâ€™s [Quietness
  rating](https://www.cyclestreets.net/help/journey/howitworks/#quietness)
  from 1 (very unpleasant for cycling) to 100 (the quietest)
  - The [BNA tool](https://bna.peopleforbikes.org/#/) which builds on the concept of traffic stress to classify segments as Low Stress or High Stress.

- Discussion of cyclability in A/B Street issue tracker: https://github.com/a-b-street/abstreet/issues/600
- Gist in Python on GitHub calculating cyclability from OSM: https://gist.github.com/aroche/d6fd03e51869c3e554f908bc14b5750b
- Methods described in by CycleStreets: [Quietness

## Thoughts on next steps (draft)

- [ ] Prototype code to generate plausible quietness ratings from OpenStreetMap data
- [ ] Wire up to a web interface
- [ ] Create a frontent to allow people to tweak the parameters affecting cyclability
- [ ] Develop default settings e.g. for different types of users (e.g. novice, experienced, confident) and implementations of different metrics (e.g. Bikeability 1 to 3 or LTS 1 to 4)
- [ ] Encode the settings that lead to these implementations in a human readable and easy-to-edit format, e.g. JSON
